## Triggering Espresso Unit Tests

To trigger Espresso Unit Tests, we need to rely on an API call:

```
POST - /api/v1/test-run/execute-test-run-async
```

There are a number of parameters accepted, find a [full list of parameters here](https://docs.experitest.com/display/TE/Manage+Test+Run+with+the+API#ManageTestRunwiththeAPI-RunningAsyncEspresso/XCUITest).

Here is an example API Request done using Postman:

![postman_api_call](images/postman_api_call.png)

## Status of the API Run

Using the following API, we can get the status of the Espresso Unit Tests:

```
GET - /api/v1/test-run/{id}/status
```

Here is an example API Request done using Postman:

![postman_api_call_get_status](images/postman_api_call_get_status.png)

## Viewing the Test Execution

We can also view the Execution Live, by following these steps:

1. Login to the SeeTest Cloud UI
2. Navigate to the Execution page:

![test_execution](images/test_execution.png)

## Viewing The Results

In the SeeTest Cloud UI, using the following steps, we can navigate to the SeeTest Reporter where the results are stored:

1. Login to the SeeTest Cloud
2. Click on your Initials > Go To Reporter:

![go_to_reporter](images/go_to_reporter.png)

3. Navigate to Tests tab:

![tests_tab](images/tests_tab.png)

If the execution was recent, it should show up in the list:

![results_list](images/results_list.png)

Otherwise also searching for the test results using the Filter option by searching with "test.run.id" followed with the Execution ID received from the API call:
